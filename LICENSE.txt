​

----LAST UPDATE TO THE BOB SIMULATOR LICENSE: 2024/08/10, YEAR/MONTH/DAY ----

​

--Rule #1: Usage Guidelines (Content you Create with our Game)--

Bob Simulator and all of it's embedded software, code, and media, is under the full copyright ownership of TC Blox Studios.

​

You are not allowed to re-sell or redistribute any of the copyrighted and protected code, software, or assets of Bob Simulator.

If you download a copy of Bob Simulator, or its related software and content, you are not allowed to redistribute it.

​

You are not allowed to use Bob Simulator to spread viruses or malware to other users through the in-game Multiplayer.

​

There are no limitations or regulations on what content you create with Bob Simulator.

We ask that you not create content and creations that spread hateful messages and prejudice, or illegal activity,

but it is not our responsibility. We take no responsibility for what you create with Bob Simulator.

​

The creations, builds, structures, maps, worlds, mods, addons, servers, skins, playermodels, texture packs, machinimas, showcases, fan-art, online videos, transformative media, and other works you create are under your ownership if said works are transformative, unique, and creative in some way. If they are, they are what we label as "Creative Works".

​

For example, spawning in a single prop and giving it a random color would not be considered a creative work.

​

Placing a bunch of props, resizing some of them, assigning them very specific colors, and arranging them in certain ways to build a large structure like a castle, or intricately designing a texture pack, intricate creative terrain modification, or other such art-pieces, especially if they make use of textures or other assets you own, would be considered creative works.

​

Machinimas, custom playermodels especially if they use custom textures, addons, servers, mods, are considered creative works if they are transformative, unique, and creative.

​

There are no all-out restrictions given by this license on what kinds of creative works you create.

You can create whatever you want.

​

We do not claim ownership, responsibility, or liability over any creative works created by you or another third-party.

You are allowed to redistribute, monetize, sell, and merchandise your creative works.

​

One Important Limitation specifically for Fan-Art:

You are not allowed to stop others from distributing transformative modifications to your creative works.

If other people make transformative remixes of your fan-art, you are not allowed to take legal action against them.

​

(Summary: You own the transformative creations you make with and about Bob Simulator, and can monetize them freely.)

 

--Rule #2: Online Media Guidelines (Online Videos, Showcases, and Machinimas)--

​

-Transformative Works, Let's Plays, and Machinimas-

​

You may create and distribute Online Videos, Machinimas, Let's Plays, and Showcases that involve videos, images,

screenshots, fan-art, and other types of media that represents Bob Simulator freely, as long as you meet the following criteria.

If you do not meet the criteria, you must get permission from TC Blox Studios:

​

1. You are not affiliated with and acting on behalf of a governmental agency or entity that is using our Content to spread hateful messages, prejudice, defamatory accusations, or activity that violates human rights.

​

If you do not meet this criteria, you must obtain legitimate permission from TC Blox Studios to proceed. (send us a support ticket)

If we give you permission, we may invoke the right to take our consent back at any time. (and will properly reach out to you if we do)

Do not abuse our leniency towards online media in an attempt to spread harmful or dishonest messages, or for unfair promotion.

​

You may create transformative works of art, such as YouTube videos, and let's play videos, or other forms of media featuring video or image media of Bob Simulator.

 

If your creative work involves the direct distribution of large portions of our copyrighted material, it must be transformative and not contain a significant portion of our copyrighted material present in our Content or otherwise.

We have the final say what constitutes "large non-transformative portions of our copyrighted material", to avoid piracy.
