## Fork of the open-source Godot Engine, a 2D and 3D cross-platform game engine
This is a fork of the open-source Godot Engine, an engine maintained by the Godot Foundation.
I am jimmybob / TonyTCB, the Grobel-Godot Engine is a fork I designed for my game Bob Simulator, among other things.

## Original READ-ME Below

**[Grobel-Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) is a feature-packed, cross-platform
game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface.** It provides a
comprehensive set of [common tools](https://godotengine.org/features), so that
users can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can
be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop
platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as
Web-based platforms and [consoles](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/platform/consoles.html).

## Free, open source and community-driven

Grobel-Godot is completely free and open source under the very permissive [MIT license](https://godotengine.org/license).
No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. The users' games are theirs, down
to the last line of engine code. Grobel-Godot's development is fully independent and
community-driven, empowering users to help shape their engine to match their
expectations. It is supported by the [Grobel-Godot Foundation](https://godot.foundation/)
not-for-profit.

Before being open sourced in [February 2014](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/commit/0b806ee0fc9097fa7bda7ac0109191c9c5e0a1ac),
Grobel-Godot had been developed by [Juan Linietsky](https://github.com/reduz) and
[Ariel Manzur](https://github.com/punto-) (both still maintaining the project)
for several years as an in-house engine, used to publish several work-for-hire
titles.
